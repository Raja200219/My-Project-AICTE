Secure Data Hiding in Images Using Steganography


Overview
This project implements steganography to securely hide encrypted messages inside images, ensuring confidential communication. It utilizes Python and various image-processing libraries to embed and extract hidden messages while maintaining image quality.

Features

âœ… Message Encryption & Decryption: Ensures double-layered security before hiding the message.

âœ… Image-Based Data Hiding: Conceals text messages within images without altering their appearance.

âœ… Efficient Extraction: Securely retrieves the hidden message from the image.

âœ… Lightweight & Fast Processing: Uses optimized Python libraries for quick execution.

âœ… Real-World Applications: Useful in cybersecurity, digital forensics, and secure communication.
